Features:
- undo guess word
- delete games
- slider for words limit (maybe also random button)
- custom time limit
- maybe max players?
- num rounds for sure
- jwt auth
- frond end improvements
- allow host to kick players
- leave game is broken if player has added words
- auth not ideal, going back a page still does let's you enter another person's view. Buttons still don't work though, but start game will work
